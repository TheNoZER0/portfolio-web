        I'm a Brisbane‑based engineering student transitioning into the Bachelor / Masters of
        Engineering program at the University of Queensland. With a strong foundation in
        mathematics and computer science, my passion lies at the intersection of
        embedded systems, machine learning and quantitative research. Whether it's building
        autonomous race cars, developing generative models for medical data or crafting
        trading algorithms, I enjoy tackling challenging problems and translating
        cutting‑edge research into real‑world impact.
